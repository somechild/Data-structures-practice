# Data-structure implementations


## The Binary-Tree
.js Binary tree constructor with an array of data that needs to be sorted and can be compared using &lt; and > and == js operators like Strings and Numbers


> implements initializing, adding, removing and searching functions 

*I still need to comment the jQuery stuff which sets up the visualization, but I'm  planning on having it visualized using the HTML5 canvas in the near future with animations and everything -- so maybe I'll just comment the stuff then

## Sorts
Merge sort done right now in CPP.

Gotta make it more efficient though especially in terms of space complexity and probably can also be improved in terms of time complexity


## Going to push soon
* **Quick Sort** - currently working on
* BFS, DFS w. graph structs
* Heap
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Trie
