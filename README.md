# Data-structure implementations


## The Binary-Tree
.js Binary tree constructor with an array of data that needs to be sorted and can be compared using &lt; and > and == js operators like Strings and Numbers


> implements initializing, adding, removing and searching functions 

*I still need to comment the jQuery stuff which sets up the visualization, but I'm  planning on having it visualized using the HTML5 canvas in the near future with animations and everything -- so maybe I'll just comment the stuff then

## Sorts
Merge-sort & Quicksort have been done in CPP.

Gotta make the code more efficient though especially in terms of space complexity and probably can also be improved slightly in terms of time complexity


## Linked List
Done in CPP with a simple class and pointers

## Stack & Queue
Basically use a vector in CPP and then the way you access/remove items changes by structure



## Going to push soon
* *Heap* - up next
* BFS, DFS w. graph structs
* Trie
